In this Mini project, we would be combining multiple services and open-source tools to make a chatbot that recommends songs based on the tone of the conversation which the user is having with the chatbot. The purpose of chat bots is to support and scale business teams in their relations with customers. It could live in any major chat applications like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.

**Major project**
- EditRox :
EditRox is a pair coding platform that provides features to interact with peers and code at the same time with high quality video
and audio calling feature and real time code update feature. You get a feature to compile & run the program. The video calling is
supported by WebRTC that provides low latency and also industry standards. The video call is end to end encrypted, so no need to
worry about the security. This app can handle up to 20 participants in a single room and can be scaled up to 100 participants
depending upon the business needs. Its infrastructure is equipped with load balancer and reverse proxy that take care of the app at
the time of peak load and load scarcity.
After the spread of covid-19, everything in the IT industry has become remote i.e..From meeting to code discussion etc are handled
over online using different applications. But the problem with the existing meeting applications is they do not provide a way to edit
their code in real time within the application itself. Even a very few applications have the feature of editing, they are either paid or
require high bandwidth. We came up with the development of EditRox, A real time code editing web app that is equipped with
video + audio calling feature.
